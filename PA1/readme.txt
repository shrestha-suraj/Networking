There are 4 four java files and 4 class files in this folder. The java files responsible for
TCP Protocol are TCPServer.java and TCPClient.java whereas the files responsible for UDP Protocol
are UDPServer.java and UDPClient.java. These files have their respective class file.

The process to run the code is to run two files simulataneously. First we need to compile and run
the Server java file and after that we need to run its corresponding Client file with some input.
When we send in the input as any text, the server present in our local host responses by capitalizing
all the words in our input. Hence, we create a small clinet server network.
